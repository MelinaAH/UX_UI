## CROSS-CULTURAL DESIGN: Researching Social media culture – Pakistan vs. Finland
## UX/UI Project

**Course:** Cross-Cultural Design, Tampere University
**Team:** 5 members
**Target Group:** Individuals from Pakistan and Finland 

### Project Overview
In the Cross-Cultural Design course at Tampere University, our 5-person team explored the social media cultures of Pakistan and Finland to examine how cultural differences impact social media usage. By comparing Pakistan’s collectivistic society with Finland’s individualistic culture, we aimed to understand how these cultural norms influence social media behavior, including content restrictions. Based on the study results, we designed improvements and new features for Instagram to better meet user needs and created low-fidelity prototypes.

### Goals
The goal of the project was to investigate the impact of cultural differences on social media usage and design improvements and new features for Instagram to better meet user needs. This included:

- Exploring cultural differences in social media behavior
- Examining the influence of cultural norms on social media practices
- Understanding how cultural differences shape user content restrictions on social media

### Methods
- Literature review
- User research (photomontage and interviews)
- Analysis with affinity diagrams
- Cultural personas and moodboard
- Design guidelines
- Concept design and low-fidelity prototype

To deepen our understanding of cultural influences on online behavior and user engagement, we conducted a thorough literature review. We analyzed state-of-the-art sources, focusing on how cultural models, especially Hofstede’s model, reflect internet culture and its interplay with traditional cultural norms.

We conducted cultural research using a photomontage and interviews to gather insights from users. Our study aimed to uncover what types of content participants found enjoyable or annoying, what content they would like to post in the future, and whether cultural differences influenced these views. The results were analyzed to identify key user needs.

### My Role
- Prototype development
- Report chapter 2.2 Literature review (my part)
- Report chapter 2.4 Study with the cultural probes
- Report chapter 3.4 Concept design and low-fidelity prototype
- Report chapter 5.2 Reflection on multi-cultural teamwork.

### Literature Review Results
- Collectivistic cultures prioritise family, friends, and group
- Individualistic cultures prioritise individual needs and interests
- The use of social media is more common in Finland than in Pakistan
- Members of collectivistic cultures tend to maintain fewer but closer friendships compared to those in individualistic cultures
- Cultural awareness is an important aspect of respecting differences
- Ethical culture stimulates social media sharing
- Culturally sensitive themes can enhance user engagement

### Design Decisions
Findings from user research and the literature review highlight the importance of spreading awareness of different cultures for social media usage. Users who are not aware of different cultures face challenges when interacting with a multicultural social circle. Thus, our design concept aims to resolve this challenge through one of the most widely used social media platforms, Instagram.

### Design Concept
Two main features of our concept:
1. Cultural Theme based content
2. Filtering out unwanted content using AI image detection to block undesirable content

### Design Process
- 1. Cultural Personas and Moodboard:
Based on our research, we developed cultural personas to represent the distinct user groups from Pakistan and Finland. These personas guided our design decisions and were complemented by a moodboard that captured the visual and emotional tone of the project.

- 2. Design Guidelines:
We established design guidelines that would help us address the cultural nuances identified during our research. These guidelines ensured that our design remained culturally sensitive and user-centered.

- 3. Concept Design and Low-Fidelity Prototype:
Leveraging the insights gathered, we re-designed Instagram to better address cultural differences and enhance the user experience. We developed low-fidelity prototypes to demonstrate the following key features:

- Thematic Reels Categorization:
Reels are categorized into themes such as "Pakistan Culture," "Fashion," "Animals," and "Art." This allows users to explore content relevant to specific cultural themes.

- Cultural Awareness Promotion:
A feature promoting cultural awareness, where clicking on the "Pakistan Culture" theme opens Reels related to Pakistani culture. Users have the option to "Learn more about Pakistan culture," providing them with detailed information.

- Content Restrictions:
Users can define restricted words, preventing others from tagging or mentioning them in content containing those specific terms, ensuring that cultural sensitivities are respected.

**Team:** 5 persons
**Collaboration partners:** Tampere University and VTT
**Target Group:** Individuals who primarily use cars but consider public transport a viable alternative

### Project Overview
As part of the Methods in Human-Centered Design course, our 5-member team conducted a research study on DeMo (Decarbonizing Transport and Mobility through Data-Driven Modal Shift). The project aimed to explore strategies and tools to encourage individuals to shift from car usage to more sustainable transportation options, such as public transport or active mobility.

### Goals
The project aimed to explore strategies and tools to encourage individuals to transition from car usage to sustainable alternatives, such as public transport or active mobility. This is crucial for achieving global and national carbon emission reduction goals and promoting urban sustainability. The project, named Decarbonizing Transport and Mobility through Data-driven Modal Shift (DeMo), is research-oriented and involves collaboration with partners Tampere University and VTT. This collaboration stands at the forefront of urban sustainability, focusing on cities like Tampere and Helsinki, where despite commendable efforts, the car remains the predominant mode of transport.

### Methods
- User research (semi-structured interviews and surveys)
- Data analysis (affinity diagrams and thematic analysis)
- User personas and stories
- Initial concept ideation
- Competitor analysis
- Concept development
- Concept validation via surveys
- Prototyping (low-fidelity)
- Iteration based on user feedback

We conducted semi-structured face-to-face interviews and surveys in both Finnish and English to understand user preferences. The target group included individuals who primarily use cars but consider public transport a viable alternative. Data was analyzed using affinity diagrams and thematic analysis to create user personas and user stories. Based on these insights, we developed an initial concept idea and conducted preliminary validation. We also performed a competitor analysis to understand the strengths and weaknesses of existing solutions in the market. The concept was refined and validated with participants before proceeding to prototyping. Low-fidelity prototypes were created and evaluated with users, and iterations were made based on their feedback.

### My Role
- Designed interview questions in collaboration with the team
- Conducted two interviews with car users, recorded the interviews, and created transcripts
- Developed user persona based on research findings
- Collaborated on concept design
- Primarily responsible for creating the prototype
- Conducted a usability test on the prototype and iterated it based on user feedback

### Detailed Description

#### Key Challenges
One of the key challenges identified in the user study was that many desired improvements, such as increased frequency of public transportation, expanded route networks, and heated bus shelters, are difficult to implement cost-effectively. 

#### Solution: Unified Travel Pass
Based on user research, we developed the concept of the Unified Travel Pass – a mobile application that provides users with a streamlined way to plan and pay for public transportation across Finland. The app offers:

- real-time route planning
- tracking
- bonus rewards for using public transit

These features make public transport a more attractive option for commuters.

#### Full Description of Features
Our app aims to make travelling easier, sustainable, and environmentally friendly throughout Finland. Users can use it to pay for short or long distance trips on various modes of transport, such as buses, trams, trains, scooters, bicycles, and more. Users can get a digital card and/or a physical card with NFC functionality if they wish. Loading both travel cards is easy and can be done using various payment methods such as via card, MobilePay, bank, NFC, and more.

In the app, users can plan routes from their chosen starting point to their desired destination, selecting either departure or arrival time. By default, the app automatically sets today's date and the current time as the departure time options. Once a day and time are chosen, the app displays available transportation options with schedules closest to the selected departure time. In addition to public transportation, the app always prioritises the most environmentally friendly options at the top, such as bicycles or electric scooters. Car-sharing or renting options are also available but are presented last, as they are not the most environmentally friendly.

Users are presented with comprehensive information about their journey, including when to begin walking to the stop/station, departure times of vehicles, transfer schedules (such as switching from bus to tram), total travel time from start to finish, the cost of the journey based on the user's passenger status type (child, student, conscript, adult, pensioner, unemployed, and disabled), and the CO2 emissions associated with the journey. Despite prioritising speed and convenience over sustainability, users are equipped with data on the carbon footprint of each choice, promoting environmentally conscious decisions.

After users select their preferred option, they are shown the chosen route on a map, where they can also track the real-time movement of vehicles. The map also displays the walking route and time to the stop, as well as the estimated arrival time of the vehicle.

If the Unified Travel Pass does not have sufficient balance, users can either top up the card within the app or alternatively purchase a single ticket. Users always need to buy a seat ticket for the train, which they can do directly from the app. The app also notifies users if the Unified Travel Pass has enough balance to cover the bus, tram, or metro fare and encourages them to continue with the train ticket purchase.

Users can add passengers and automatically switch between offered seat options. Unused and used tickets purchased within the app can be found conveniently on the Tickets page, where users can present them to the conductor for inspection and later reference.

Users can earn bonuses for each use of public transportation. The user's bonus level increases based on their usage of public transportation. The more they use, the more they benefit. Users can convert bonuses into money for the Unified Travel Pass and use them to pay for journeys made on public transportation. Therefore, the payment is always determined based on the user's passenger status type.

### Design Decisions
In developing the Unified Travel Pass, we focused on creating a user-friendly and comprehensive solution that addresses the key challenges identified in our research. We prioritized features that enhance the user experience and promote sustainable transportation choices. Our iterative design process ensured that user feedback was incorporated at every stage, resulting in a well-rounded and effective solution.

### Documentation
The entire project is documented in a detailed project report, highlighting our findings, design process, and the final concept.

This project demonstrates the importance of user-centered research in developing practical and sustainable solutions for transportation challenges and showcases the potential of data-driven approaches in promoting modal shifts towards more eco-friendly mobility options.



## USABILITY EVALUATION METHODS: Usability Evaluation of Open University Website

**Course:** Usability Evaluation Methods, Tampere University
**Team:** 5 persons
**Target Group:** Individuals applying to study Open University

### Project Overview
During the Usability Evaluation Methods course at Tampere University, our 5-person team conducted a comprehensive usability evaluation of the Open University website, specifically focusing on the student application process.

### Goals
The project aimed to identify and address usability issues in the application process for the Open University, enhancing the user experience and making the process more efficient and user-friendly.

### Methods
- Heuristic evaluation
- Usability testing
- Task performance analysis
- Questionnaires
- Semi-structured interviews

We began with a heuristic evaluation, identifying and classifying usability issues based on severity. This was followed by usability testing, which involved setting up the testing environment, recruiting participants, and preparing test tasks. Testing was conducted remotely via Zoom, with a moderator guiding the participant and two observers noting task completion times, user behaviour, and body language.

### My role
- Conducted heuristic evaluation independently
- Collaborated on planning usability test tasks and arrangements
- Recruited one participant
- Acted as moderator and observer during test sessions
- Responsible for Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 in the final report

### Detailed Description

#### Heuristic Evaluation
Our project began with a heuristic evaluation of the service pathway for applying to the Open University. We identified usability issues and classified them based on severity, using a scale from 1 to 4:

- **1. Critical Issue:** Prevents the service from being used as intended.
- **2. Major Usability Issue:** Significantly impairs the user experience.
- **3. Minor Usability Issue:** Slightly impedes the service's usability.
- **4. Cosmetic Issue:** Affects the visual polish without impacting functionality.

In addition to usability issues, we also noted general comments, denoted by "C" for comments on successful features or suggestions, and "T" for technical issues related to implementation errors. The findings from the heuristic evaluation were compiled into a separate report.

#### Usability Testing and Test Report
Following the heuristic evaluation, we conducted usability testing on the website, particularly focusing on the application process. The usability testing involved several key components:

- **Test Arrangements:** Setting up the testing environment, recruiting participants, and preparing test tasks. Before the actual tests, a pilot test was conducted to ensure the success of the usability test and the suitability of the test tasks. The pilot test results were also used to compile the final results.
- **Test Execution:** Testing was conducted remotely via Zoom, with a moderator guiding the participant and two observers noting task completion times, user behaviour, and body language. Each test session was allocated one hour, with half an hour dedicated to test tasks.
- **Test Tasks:** Participants were asked to search for courses, locate the application form, and complete the application process. Additionally, we assessed how easily users could find important information on the website. During the usability test, participants performed assigned tasks while thinking aloud. This helped reveal their thoughts during task execution. Participant backgrounds, satisfaction with the service, and user experience were assessed through interviews and questionnaires.

The usability testing included five participants and utilised multiple methods such as task performance analysis, questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews. The results of the usability testing were documented in a test report, which included the success rates and task completion times, positive findings, descriptions of usability issues, and recommendations for further development.

#### Design decisions
In conducting the usability evaluation, we focused on identifying critical usability issues that significantly impact the user experience. We prioritized issues based on severity to ensure that the most pressing problems were addressed first. Our approach to usability testing was designed to capture a comprehensive view of user interactions, including task performance, user satisfaction, and overall experience.

### Summary
The usability evaluation methods used included usability testing, questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews. Five participants were recruited from the testers' acquaintances. Usability testing was conducted remotely via Zoom, with a moderator and at least two observers present in each session. The moderator explained the test process, assisted participants during tasks, and conducted post-test interviews. Observers recorded task completion times, monitored participant behaviour, and noted body language if the participant's camera was on.
