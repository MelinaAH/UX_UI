# UX/UI PROJECTS

## CROSS-CULTURAL DESIGN: Social media culture – Pakistan vs. Finland
In this project, we explored the social media culture in comparison between Pakistan and Finland. The goal of the project was to investigate the impact of cultural differences on social media usage. There can be significant differences between collectivistic countries, like Pakistan, and individualistic ones, such as Finland. Therefore, we aimed to investigate if and how cultural norms impact social media behaviour, including potential restrictions on user content. Based on the study results, we designed improvements and new features for Instagram to better meet user needs and created low-fidelity prototypes. 

I was responsible for the prototypes and the report chapters: 2.2 Literature review, 2.4 Study with the cultural probes, 3.4 Concept design and low-fidelity prototype, and 5.2 Reflection on multi-cultural teamwork.

## HUMAN-CENTERED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT: TimeWise – an AI calendar assistant
The assignment for the project was to envision a future solution for an existing user problem, need, desire, or challenge or to identify a completely new opportunity. This problem, challenge, need, or desire was to be found through user studies. The target market timeframe is 2030-2035, providing a unique opportunity to create a forward-looking solution.

The specific task was to design an AI-based solution for planning one’s weekly schedule, including commuting to work or school, grocery shopping, and other necessary weekly activities.

### Project Description:
The primary goals and objectives of the TimeWise AI-powered calendar assistant project are to enhance time management efficiency, streamline scheduling processes, and improve overall productivity for users. Furthermore, the project aims to integrate cutting-edge technologies to provide users with a futuristic and intuitive scheduling experience that anticipates their needs in the coming decades. By leveraging AI capabilities, the calendar assistant seeks to personalize scheduling recommendations, optimize task prioritization, and enhance user engagement. Ultimately, the project aims to create a user-centric solution that addresses the diverse scheduling needs of individuals across various contexts, from personal to professional settings.

## USER EXPERIENCE: DESIGN AND EVALUATION: Sustainable Living in the Kitchen 
The goal of this project was to apply the Experience-Driven Design (EDD) approach to design and evaluate a prototype that combines physical and digital elements or is purely digital. We focused on determining experience goals (UX goals), generating design implications based on these goals, designing a prototype, and evaluating its effectiveness with end-users.

### Project Topic: Sustainable Living in the Kitchen
We conducted interviews and survey-based user research to understand potential user attitudes toward sustainable living, as well as their needs and pain points when adapting to sustainable practices. This informed our design decisions in the later phases of the project.

### Prototype Description:
We designed an application aimed at helping users avoid food waste. The main features of the application include:
Home Page:
  - An icon reflecting the user's current sustainability level through emotions (smiling when sustainability practices are high, frowning when low).
  - A "Sustainability Coach" button that provides a detailed overview of the user's sustainability practices and the icon’s emotional state.

**Sustainability Coach Page:**
  - Offers detailed sustainability tips, reminders to recycle, and advice such as freezing leftovers.
  - Supports ease of use by allowing users to quickly gauge their habits and explore detailed descriptions if desired.

**Kitchen View:**
  - Users can take a picture of a new grocery item, and the application uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and machine vision to recognize and add it to a digital list.
  - The kitchen view allows users to view, sort, and edit their groceries, switching between fridge and cupboard views.
  - Each item shows a picture, name, and expiration date, and warns when an expiration date is near.
  - Users can edit grocery details and specify whether they consumed or discarded an item.

**Progress Reporting Page:**
  - Displays statistics on the user's sustainability habits and actions.
  - Tracks savings over specific timeframes, supporting the experience goal of financial safety.

**Through this project, we learned how to:**
  - Determine and set experience goals.
  - Generate design implications from these goals.
  - Design and prototype an application.
  - Evaluate the prototype with end-users to ensure the goals are effectively manifested.

**I took charge of the following chapters in the project report:**
  - Chapter 2: Related Work and its Subchapters
  - Chapter 4: Design Explained and Subchapter 4.1
  - Chapter 6: Discussions and all subchapters

When designing the prototype, I worked on the Home page and when planning the prototype evaluation process, I took the lead in formulating questions for the question-completion form.

## METHODS IN HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN: Research Study of DeMo
Our team of five members worked on the Research Study of the DeMo project as part of the course Methods in Human-Centered Design, focusing on exploring strategies and tools to promote the shift from car usage to sustainable alternatives, such as public transport and active mobility. We embarked on a full human-centred design process to achieve our goals:

- Conducted extensive user research using semi-structured face-to-face interviews and surveys.
- Analyzed the data using affinity diagrams and thematic analysis to understand user preferences and behaviours regarding transportation modes.
- Designed and prototyped the Multi-Transport-Pass System, aiming to integrate various transport modes into a cohesive service concept.
- Validated the concept through prototype usability testing, iteratively refining the prototype based on user feedback.

## USABILITY EVALUATION METHODS: Usability Evaluation of Open University Website
As part of a 5-person team in the Usability Evaluation Methods course, we conducted a comprehensive project involving heuristic evaluation and usability testing. The process included planning and running a pilot test, conducting usability tests, analyzing the results, and compiling a final report. The project provided hands-on experience in evaluating user interfaces and enhancing usability through systematic testing and analysis.
